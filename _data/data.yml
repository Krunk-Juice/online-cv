    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      A technologically driven individual. Starting as a biology student, and 
      transitioning to a computer scientist. I have had the priveledge of 
      learning from many great teachers that have provided me the tools and to
      guidance to problem-solve through various complex issues. I have 
      volunteered with various health organizations to provide patient care. 
      During my time as a graduate student at CSUF I had the oportunity to 
      instruct a computer science compilers and languages course for one 
      semester. At the end of my time at CSUF, my advisor guided me with how 
      to develop a conference paper that I would author, present at the 
      [2023 IEEE World AI IoT Congress](https://worldaiiotcongress.org/), and 
      publish in [IEEE Xplore® digital library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174419).
